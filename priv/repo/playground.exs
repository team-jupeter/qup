## Ecto Playground
#
# This script sets up a sandbox for experimenting with Ecto. To
# use it, just add the code you want to try into the Playground.play/0
# function below, then execute the script via mix:
#
#?   mix run priv/repo/playground.exs
#
# The return value of the play/0 function will be written to the console
#
# To get the test data back to its original state, just run:
#
#   mix ecto.reset
#
alias MusicDB.Repo
alias MusicDB.{Artist, Album, Track, Genre, Log, AlbumWithEmbeds, ArtistEmbed, TrackEmbed}
alias Ecto.Multi
alias MusicDB.Band

import Ecto.Query
import Ecto.Changeset

defmodule Playground do
  # this is just to hide the "unused import" warnings while we play
  def this_hides_warnings do
    [Artist, Album, Track, Genre, Repo, Multi, Log, AlbumWithEmbeds, ArtistEmbed, TrackEmbed]
    from(a in "artists")
    from(a in "artists", where: a.id == 1)
    cast({%{}, %{}}, %{}, [])
  end

  #?

  def play do


  end
  #?
end

# add your test code to Playground.play above - this will execute it
# and write the result to the console
