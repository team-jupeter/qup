# COREAn PASS


**COREA(Coded Openhash Reports on ~~Economic~~ Every Activities) aNd PASS(Passport with Abstracted Safe Society)**
* This is the combination of two keenly related projects, COREA and PASS. 
* **COREA** is to represent every human & non-human activity as a form of Openhash report, which is to be stored permanently, and can not be forged. 
* **PASS** is to code any kind of humane organizations and their activities into unmanned autonomous systems.
* The project is an on-going project for both coding exercises using tools like Openhash/Elixir/Phoenix/Ecto, and preparing a humble startup company to convert/transform current societies into **Contactless Societies(비접촉 사회)** after COVID 19.
* More concretely, one goal of this project is to code an electronic passport, called **PASS**, which any nation can adopt for its immigration process or quarantine processes at airports, terminals, clubs, and schools etc., to protect people from infectious virus such as COVID 19.
* Another goal of this project is to code any governmental services and social infrastructures into **Extensions of PASS** for their citizens to easily utilize those governmental services and social infrastructures such as education, traffic, logistics, online markets and internet-based banks etc. Some examples of those governmental services are autonomous or unmanned tax services, city halls, police stations, courts, and the congress etc. Those coded unmanned governmental facilities are for **Contactless Societies(비접촉 사회)** after COVID. Our goal is to code governments for citizens to use any governmental service without visiting public offices.
* Some examples of social infrastructures to be coded and put into as **Extensions of PASS** are autonomous and unmanned online schools, online medical facilities, autonomous traffics & logistics, and various kinds of markets etc. Our goal is to transform all kinds of current social functions into contactless forms. 
* Via our codes, we hope to provide an **Abstracted Safe Society** which can be easily transformed into concrete forms by any nation or any society which adopted COREAn PASS.
* Our term **Safe Society** means to protect people from hazardous diseases, crimes, and, first of all, poverty.
* This is an open source coding exercise based on **Openhash**, a blockchain technology, and phoenix_liveview_example(https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view).
* The progress of coding PASS is recorded as educational coding video contents(Korean 한국어 강좌) and uploaded to Youtube channel on daily basis,[ \[Team Jupeter\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsZgh8szGYA&list=PLlSZlNj22M7QRBGl7s9WnT0xqKGDuzPKk).

# Goal

* Coding an **electronic unified passport called PASS** for all nations to adopt easily, especially for unified quarantine processes at worldwide airports.
* All immigration services of worldwide nations share passenger data, share the same quarantine/immigration processes regardless of their locations and nationalities, and control airports of their jurisdiction respectively.
* All kinds of governmental services or national infrastructures will be coded and plugged into PAS as Extensions to achieve autonomous & unmanned organizations. 

# Explaining the Features of PASS with the case at airports. 

* For 7 billion population of the world, every human on the earth(= user) has his/her unique ID, an elixir process, and is connected to the system 24hrs/365days. Among them only a few will use PASS system at the same time, and the rest will be at sleep mode. 
* On the other hand, a user(= passenger) may be active when connected to the web via WiFi or mobile network, or inactive when disconnected.
* At airports worldwide, PASS is expected to operate using thousands of SAMSUNG Galaxy S20+ equipped at the gates of airports, and numerous ordinary smartphones(for passengers), without special machines like fingerprint readers and thermometer etc.
* At airports, all users(= passengers) are expected to present electronic health certificates issued by hospitals authorized by their government. That is to say, we should code the working algorithm of issuing various certificates. 
* Via their smartphones with GPS, all departing/boarding passengers will automatically present their visiting places for the last 2 weeks before departure or boarding an international airlines. 
* Also via their smartphones, all arrivaing passengers will provide their visiting places for the next 2 weeks after arrival or departing airports.
* An occurrence of a new epidemic patient will be informed to all the related nations in real time with the related data such as his/her current location, visited places and contacted people he/she has met for the last 2 weeks etc.
* Some related expenses and fees can be paid from those users' bank accounts. That is all users of the system have bank accounts on a global banking system. 
* No data can be forged or deleted. 
* No personal data can be accessed or misused without the permission of its owner or by legitimate processes. 

# Some Extensions of PASS we are coding.
* We are coding one autonomous and contactless bank called **GAB, 갭** to substitute tens of current banks including not only normal banks, but also central banks such as Korean Central Bank.
* We are coding an autonomous tax service, called **SAT(셋, Semi Autonomous Taxation)**, to substitute the **Korean Tax Service 한국 국세청**, a manned and not autonomous governmental tax organization. 
* We are coding one ubiquitous market, called **JANG(장, Just A Normalized Goods)**, to substitute numerous current markets including whole sale stores, convenience stores and even online shopping malls like Amazon.
* We are coding a direct democracy system, called **ART(아트, All Represent Themselves)**, to substitute current indirect democracy systems including the National Parliament of Korea.
