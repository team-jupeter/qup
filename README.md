## qup(quarantine unified passport) == 검역 통합 여권
* This project is for both coding education and startup business.
* The goal of this project is to code an electronic passport which any nation can adopt for its immigration process and quarantine purpose to protect its citizen from infectious virus such as COVID 19.
* This is an open source coding exercise based on phoenix_liveview_example(https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view).
* The progress of coding is recorded as educational video contents and uploaded to Youtube channel,[ \[Team Jupeter\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsZgh8szGYA&list=PLlSZlNj22M7QRBGl7s9WnT0xqKGDuzPKk).

# Goal

* Establish an unified immigration management at worldwide airports. 
* Coding an **electronic unified passport** for all nations to adopt easily, especially for unified quarantine processes at worldwide airports.
* All nations share data of airport passengers to protect, control and/or restrict the spread of dangerous viruses such as COVID 19. 
* All immigration services of worldwide nations share passenger data, share the same quarantine/immigration processes regardless of their locations and nationalities, and control airports of their jurisdiction respectively.

# Features of the system

* For 7 billion population of the world, every human on the earth(= user) has his/her unique ID and a elixir process, and is connected to the system 24hrs/365days. Among them only a few will use airport at the same time, and the rest will be at sleep mode. 
* On the other hand, a user(= passenger) may be active when connected to the web via WiFi or mobile network, or inactive when disconnected.
* The system is expected to operate using thousands of SAMSUNG Galaxy S20+ equipped at the gates of airports, and numerous ordinary smartphones(for passengers), without special machines like fingerprint readers and thermometer etc.
* At airports, all users(= passengers) are expected to present electronic health certificates issued by hospitals authorized by their government. That is to say, we should code the working algorithm of issuing various certificates. 
* Via their smartphones with GPS, all departing/boarding passengers will automatically present their visiting places for the last 2 weeks before departure or boarding an international airlines. 
* Also via their smartphones, all arrivaing passengers will provide their visiting places for the next 2 weeks after arrival or departing airports.
* An occurence of a new epidemic patient will be informed of all the related nations in real time with the related data such as his/her present location, visited places and people he/she has met for the last 2 weeks etc.
* Some related expenses and fees can be paid from users' bank accounts. That is all users of the system have bank accounts on a global banking system. 
* No data can be forged or deleted. 
* No personal data can be accessed or misused without the permission of its owner.
