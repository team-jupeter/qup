# COREA(Connected/Coded Openhash Reports on Economic Activities)

* This is an on-going project for both coding exercises and preparing a humble startup to convert/transform current societies into **Contactless Societies(비접촉 사회)** after COVID 19.
* More concretely, one goal of this project is to code an electronic passport, called **PAS**, which any nation can adopt for its immigration process or quarantine processes at airports, terminals, clubs, and schools etc., to protect people from infectious virus such as COVID 19.
* Another goal of this proejct is to code any governmental services or infrastructures as **Extensions of PAS** for their citizens to easily utilize those governmental services. Examples of those governmental services are autonomous or unmanned tax services, city halls, police stations, courts, and the congress etc. Those unmanned governmental facilities are for **Contactless Societies(비접촉 사회).
* Them Examples of social infrastructures to be coded and put into as extenstions of PAS are autonomous and unmanned schools, medical facilities, traffics, logistics  and various kinds markets etc. Our goal is to transform all kinds of current social functions into contactless forms. 
* This is an open source coding exercise based on **Openhash**, a blockchain technology, and phoenix_liveview_example(https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view).
* The progress of coding PAS is recorded as educational video contents and uploaded to Youtube channel on daily basis,[ \[Team Jupeter\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsZgh8szGYA&list=PLlSZlNj22M7QRBGl7s9WnT0xqKGDuzPKk).

# Goal

* Establish an unified immigration management at worldwide airports.
* Let **PAS** do all kinds of identification and/or quarantine processes.
* Coding an **electronic unified passport called PAS or PASS** for all nations to adopt easily, especially for unified quarantine processes at worldwide airports.
* All nations share data of moving people such as airport passengers to protect, control and/or restrict the spread of dangerous viruses such as COVID 19. 
* All immigration services of worldwide nations share passenger data, share the same quarantine/immigration processes regardless of their locations and nationalities, and control airports of their jurisdiction respectively.
* All kinds of governmental services or national infrastructures are coded and plugged into PAS as automous unmanned organizations. 

# Explaining the Features of PAS with the case at airports. 

* For 7 billion population of the world, every human on the earth(= user) has his/her unique ID and a elixir process, and is connected to the system 24hrs/365days. Among them only a few will use PAS system at the same time, and the rest will be at sleep mode. 
* On the other hand, a user(= passenger) may be active when connected to the web via WiFi or mobile network, or inactive when disconnected.
* At airports worldwide, PAS is expected to operate using thousands of SAMSUNG Galaxy S20+ equipped at the gates of airports, and numerous ordinary smartphones(for passengers), without special machines like fingerprint readers and thermometer etc.
* At airports, all users(= passengers) are expected to present electronic health certificates issued by hospitals authorized by their government. That is to say, we should code the working algorithm of issuing various certificates. 
* Via their smartphones with GPS, all departing/boarding passengers will automatically present their visiting places for the last 2 weeks before departure or boarding an international airlines. 
* Also via their smartphones, all arrivaing passengers will provide their visiting places for the next 2 weeks after arrival or departing airports.
* An occurence of a new epidemic patient will be informed of all the related nations in real time with the related data such as his/her present location, visited places and people he/she has met for the last 2 weeks etc.
* Some related expenses and fees can be paid from users' bank accounts. That is all users of the system have bank accounts on a global banking system. 
* No data can be forged or deleted. 
* No personal data can be accessed or misused without the permission of its owner. 

# Other features of PAS under coding.
* We are coding one autonomous and contactless bank to substitute tens of current banks including the central bank of Korea.
* We are coding an autonomous tax service to substitute the Korean Tax Service, an governmental organization. 
* We are coding one ubiquotous market to subsitite numerous current markets including whole sale stores, convience stores and even online shopping malls like Amazaon.
* We are coding a direct democracy system to substitute current indirect democracy systems including the Congress of Korea.
